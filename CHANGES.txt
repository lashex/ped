0.2.2 -- first round of getting ts_calc working
* fixed sunspec_data.Point.typ property setting that takes into account SunSpec
  SMDX types, to convert the Point.value into the correct Python typed value.
  With Point.type and Point.value fixed now the ts_calc calculations work

0.2.1 -- works in a much more friendly fashion.
* plantextract package now has a 'ped.py' module instead of using a redundant name.
* XSDs are just loaded locally by 'ped.py' and 'smdx.py' without needing to be passed in.
